                    <p>Australia is a country that occupies the mainland of the same name, which is washed by the Indian
                        and Pacific oceans.
                        The capital of Australia is a city called Canberra. For European tourists, this country will
                        seem almost like a
                        different world, why so, you can read more below.</p>

                <div class="wrapper_page_textcard">
                    <p>Australia is a country surprisingly rich in natural and climatic features.</p>
                    <p>Due to the fact that Australia is a rather large country, therefore, in terms of tourism, it is a
                        favorable place for
                        recreation. But you also need to consider that this is one of the driest continents on the
                        planet, since three-quarters
                        of its surface has insufficient moisture.</p>
                    <p>So, one of the most obvious of the features of the climate is that the seasons of the year are
                        different from those to
                        which we are accustomed. Often, the warmest month of the year is January (in addition, the
                        warmest months of the year
                        are November, December, February), and the coldest is July (others: May, June, August). That is,
                        what we used to call
                        winter in Australia will be considered Australian summer, and what is summer - Australian
                        winter, and so on. This
                        phenomenon is connected with the location of the continent in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
                    <p>
                        Due to its position mainly in tropical latitudes, the mainland receives a huge amount of solar
                        heat. During the
                        Australian summer, in the center of the country the temperature reaches an average of +35°C
                        during the day, but quickly
                        drops to around +10°C at night. And during the Australian winter, during the day the air
                        temperature is +15°C, and at
                        night +5°C.
                    </p>
                    <p>The change of seasons is quite clearly manifested only in the northern and southern parts of the
                        continent, but it is
                        expressed not in seasonal temperature changes, which are quite high throughout the continent,
                        but in the seasonality of
                        precipitation. “Wet season” and “dry season” in Australia are concepts that are associated with
                        very sharp changes in
                        plant aspects, living conditions, economic opportunities, and so on.</p>
                    <p>There are few large rivers on the Australian mainland, except for the island of Tasmania.
                        Australia's main river is the
                        Murray, with tributaries the Goulburn, the Murrumbidgee and the Darling.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of summer, these rivers are the most full-flowing, because. snow is melting in
                        the mountains. They
                        become very shallow during the hot season. Even the Darling, which is the longest in Australia,
                        gets lost during a
                        drought in the sands.</p>
                    <p>The lakes of Australia are predominantly waterless basins. The largest lakes in Australia include
                        Lake Eyre, Gairdner,
                        Garnpang, etc.</p>
                    <p>For example, Lake Hillier, it is bright pink, is located on the Middle Island. Even if you fill
                        something with water
                        from the lake, its color will not change. There are no algae in the lake, and scientists have
                        not given an explanation
                        for what exactly gives the lake such a pink color.</p>

                    <p>Or there is the luminous Gippsland Lake. It is a complex of swamps and lakes located in the state
                        of Victoria. Some
                        argue that the lake glows as a result of the vital activity of micro-organisms living in this
                        lake.</p>

                    <p>The Australian mainland for a long time, starting from the Cretaceous period, was isolated from
                        other continents of the
                        planet.</p>
                    <p>In Australia, powerful earthquakes occur infrequently, since the continent is located on the same
                        tectonic plate.
                        According to Australian scientists, the tremors were felt quite strongly, since the earthquake
                        was relatively small: it
                        occurred at a depth of 10 kilometers.</p>
                    <p>The most powerful earthquake of the 19th century occurred in South Australia in 1897. The
                        epicenter was located off the
                        coast near the city of Beechport. Most of the buildings in the city were destroyed, and
                        neighboring regions were also
                        badly affected.</p>
                    <p>But fires, droughts and floods are a very serious problem, both for the population and for
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>One of the largest gift occurred recently in 2020. The fire, according to experts, covered from 8
                        to 10 million hectares
                        of land. Several dozen people died, burned plants and animals number in the billions. Entire
                        regions were left without
                        electricity, half the continent was covered in smoke.</p>
                    <p>Fires in Australia happen every year, but in 2020 the scale of destruction is extreme.
                        The causes of fires are many, but experts see a connection between the growing risk of fires and
                        the rising temperature
                        of the water in the oceans.

                    <p>The first recorded drought occurred in Australia in 1803 in New South Wales and resulted in
                        severe crop failures. The
                        next recorded drought lasted from 1809 to 1811. The drought of 1813–1815 forced the New South
                        Wales sheep farmers to
                        look for new pastures.</p>
                    <p>The latest drought in New South Wales has been going on for six years, but the state industry
                        secretary said there is
                        little reason for gloomy forecasts.</p>
                    <p>The main paradox of Australian floods is not only in the traditionally dry climate, but also in
                        the absence of large
                        rivers in Australia. Nevertheless, flooding is one of the main Australian environmental
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>The largest river of the Murray continent (2375 km), by global standards, has rather average
                        full-flow rates and basin
                        area. Much of the Murray's tributaries often dry up during the summer.</p>
                    <p>Most of the floods in Australia occur in the east, where the largest rivers are concentrated.</p>
                    <p>The main Australian rivers, originating in these places, overflow with rainwater and flood large
                        areas of land. Also,
                        floods can be aggravated by additional causes, among which tropical storms can be distinguished.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first flood in New South Wales was recorded in 1806.</p>
                    <p>The flora and fauna of Australia is truly unique.</p>
                    <p>Few countries have such a diverse range of animals and plants.</p>
                    <p>The animal world of Australia is also amazing. There are no such animals in any other corner of
                        the globe. Almost all
                        animals in Australia are endemic, that is, they are not found anywhere in the world. Such living
                        rarities as the
                        platypus and echidna are unknown to scientists even in the fossil state. They, like the most
                        ancient mammals, lay eggs,
                        and then hatched cubs are fed with milk. When the platypus was first caught, English scientists
                        did not believe that
                        such an animal really existed. They thought that the duck's beak was glued to the skin of some
                        tropical animal. Only in
                        1884 in Montreal was the dispute between a mammal platypus or a bird resolved. In the end, it
                        was decided in favor of
                        the mammal.</p>
                    <p>Now, out of about 250 species of marsupials, 180 live in Australia. Most Australian animals
                        prefer to carry their young
                        in bags. The brightest representatives of these kind of animals is kangaroos (already become a
                        real symbol of the
                        country). In a kangaroo, a cub is born at a very early stage of development, the size of a
                        walnut. Clinging to his
                        mother's fur, he reaches the bag on her stomach. In this bag, he spends several months, eating
                        his mother's milk. Even
                        grown-up cubs, which can already move independently, hide in a bag to their mother in a moment
                        of danger.</p>
                    <img src="./img/Picture5.png" alt="">
                    <div class="wrapper_page_textcard_sub">Picture 4. Kangaroos</div>
                    <p>Also, the marsupial koala bear is very cute. He looks remotely like a bear, rather it is a plush
                        almost toy bear cub no
                        more than 80 centimeters tall. Koala lives in trees. The cubs usually sit on the mother's back,
                        clinging to her fur.
                        Sailors have repeatedly tried to bring the koala to their home, in another country. But always
                        these cute animals died
                        of hunger: they eat only young shoots of some eucalyptus trees. These are nocturnal animals.
                        With the onset of darkness,
                        they come to life and start eating. Their whole life is spent sleeping and eating.</p>

                    <div class="wrapper_page_textcard_sub">Picture 5. Marsupial koala bear</div>
                    <p>Marsupial anteaters, possums, badgers, wombats very reminiscent of marmots, and even marsupial
                        moles and marsupial
                        squirrels live on the continent. There are 125 species of marsupials in total. In the north of
                        Australia, monitor
                        lizards are found - predatory lizards 2.5 meters long. They look like land crocodiles. However,
                        many monitor lizards can
                        swim quite well. All monitor lizards climb remarkably, some even jump. Their main occupation:
                        lie in the sun, eat, drink
                        very little.</p>
                    <p>The most common bird in Australia, the emu, lives in the semi-deserts of the continent. Ostriches
                        do not fly, but they
                        can run up to 50 kilometers per hour. Australian farmers have to fence their plots with metal
                        mesh, as ostriches trample
                        the grass on the plots.</p>
                    <p>In total, about 853 species of birds live in Australia.</p>
                    <p>Many other birds also live in Australia: black swans, budgerigars, birds of paradise, lyrebirds,
                        bowerbirds.</p>
                    <p>Most rare animals are collected in Australia in national parks.</p>
                    <p>Rabbits were also a big problem for Australia, namely that there were too many of them. It all
                        started with a
                        thoughtless act, when Tom Austin, a passionate hunter, released several animals into the wild,
                        deciding that there would
                        be no consequences from this. The fact is that in most of Australia there are no predators
                        capable of holding back the
                        explosive growth of the population of any animals.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the 19th century, the results of such frivolous interference with nature became
                        visible. Rabbits
                        contributed to the extinction of several dozen species of Australian wild animals, and also
                        caused serious damage to
                        agriculture. They gnawed the young trees in the gardens and ate the crops in the fields. Rabbits
                        also significantly
                        destroyed the natural vegetation cover, which, in the arid climate of most areas, led to the
                        degradation and destruction
                        of the soil layer. In addition, due to the large consumption of grass, they became the main
                        competitors of sheep, which
                        were bred by local farmers. All these events were widespread. The number of rabbits has stepped
                        over several million
                        individuals, and the annual shooting of 2 million rabbits did not improve the situation.
                        Producers of agricultural
                        products especially suffered from the invasion of rabbits. At the beginning of the 20th century,
                        a wire fence was even
                        built in the way of the distribution of rabbits, but it was easily overcome by animals that
                        perfectly jump and dig
                        holes.</p>

                    <p>Then the Australians had to resort to the help of scientists. In 1950, specialists infected
                        rabbits with the myxomatosis
                        virus, which led to the death of European rabbits.</p>
                    <p>This led to a reduction in the rabbit population from 600 to 100 million individuals. The
                        surviving rabbits developed
                        genetic resistance to the virus, which restored the population to 200–300 million by 1991.</p>
                    <p>Despite the deplorable situation with rabbits, it became in many ways instructive and showed how
                        poorly we imagine the
                        consequences of interfering with nature. And even a harmless, at first glance, act can lead to a
                        serious environmental
                        problem, the solution of which has not been found so far.</p>
                    <p>Eucalyptus is considered a plant symbol in Australia. The tallest plant in the world is the most
                        common in Australia. At
                        the age of 350-400 years, this plant reaches a height of 100 meters. There are cases when trees
                        grew to 150-170 meters,
                        but this is extremely rare.</p>
                    <p>Eucalyptus grows incredibly fast. It is always light in eucalyptus forests, because the leaves of
                        this tree turn in
                        parallel with the falling rays of the sun. This helps the tree retain moisture.</p>
                    <p>Eucalyptus leaves contain 3-5% aromatic essential oil that kills bacteria. This oil is used for
                        colds, pneumonia. For
                        all the amazing properties of these trees in Australia, the homeland of eucalyptus, the locals
                        call them "wonder trees".</p>
                    <p>This is a huge tree that has powerful roots that go 20 and sometimes 30 meters into the ground.

                    <p>The kangaroo paw plant, which is also found nowhere else in the world, has become the emblem of
                        the state of Western
                        Australia. The bizarre shape of the velvety flower really resembles an animal's paw.</p>

                    <p>Also, an interesting example of the plant world in Australia is the bottle tree. The bottle tree
                        is often found in
                        Australia. This plant is very well adapted to heat, drought and lack of water. From a distance,
                        it looks like a giant
                        bottle. Moisture accumulates in the trunk, which is consumed in drought.</p>

                <div class="wrapper_page_textcard">
                    <p>According to 2020 data, approximately 25.5 million people live in Australia, so Australia's place
                        in terms of population
                        in the world is in the fortieth.</p>
                    <p>A significant part of the population of the country are immigrants. Every fourth inhabitant of
                        Australia was born
                        outside its borders, part of the population of Australia are the descendants of immigrants from
                        the British Isles - the
                        British, Irish, Scots. Also in 1991, approximately 250 thousand Aborigines and mestizos were
                        recorded living in the
                        country.</p>
                    <img src="./img/table.png" id="table" alt="">
                    <p>The population density varies across the country. This is due to the fact that about half of the
                        territory of Australia
                        is occupied by deserts and semi-deserts that are not suitable for habitation. Australians are
                        mostly city dwellers. As
                        we can see from the table: at the beginning of the 20th century, 50% of the country's population
                        lived in cities, after
                        the Second World War - 70%, in the 60s the rural population was 16%, in the 80s - 14%. Modern
                        Australia remains a
                        country of mass immigration, annually it receives 100-150 thousand people.</p>
                    <p>Regarding culture: it is difficult to divide the culture in Australia, as many nationalities live
                        on the continent, plus
                        the natives, who are by no means a part of civilization. The main language is English, but
                        Australia has its own dialect
                        of English, informally called "Strain". Written Australian English mostly follows the rules of
                        British English.</p>
                    <p>Of the national holidays, one of the main ones is January 26 of each year, Australia celebrates
                        the day of the country.
                        Millions of people from all over Australia take to the streets and walk tens of kilometers
                        carrying the flag of the
                        country in their hands. On this day, any cases are cancelled.</p>
                    <p>Also in Australia they celebrate the new year not only on the usual day for us on January 1st,
                        but also according to the
                        lunar calendar in the first decade of February.</p>
                    <p>From culture, literature, theaters, cinema are also developed ... However, all these industries
                        are poorly funded by the
                        state, and are mainly under private control. For example, about 90% of theaters are commercial.
                        Movies were made mostly
                        in the mid-1900s, and mostly about the first and second world wars, similarly, in the Australian
                        poetry of the 1900s,
                        you can also find most of the books on the military theme.</p>
                    <p>In general, Australians are friendly, cheerful and positive people with an interesting culture
                        and history. They are
                        always in a good mood, they are always happy! When communicating with Australians, it is
                        customary to smile, if you do
                        not follow this principle, you will be considered ill-mannered. Local residents are mobile,
                        often move and travel, relax
                        in nature, love hunting and sports, especially surfing, because its one of the favorite
                        activities for Australians.</p>

                <div class="wrapper_page_textcard">
                    <p>Human appeared in Australia 40 thousand years ago. They were newcomers from South and Southeast
                        Asia, the forerunners of
                        modern aborigines.</p>
                    <p>The discovery of Australia has long been associated with the name of the English navigator James
                        Cook. In fact, the
                        first Europeans who visited the coast of this continent and met here with scattered tribes of
                        aborigines were the Dutch:
                        Willem Jansson in 1605 and Abel Tasman in 1642 Jansson crossed the Torres Strait and sailed
                        along the coast of the Cape
                        York Peninsula, Tasman discovered the south -the western part of Tasmania, which he considered
                        part of the mainland.
                        However, these discoveries remained secret for unknown reasons.</p>
                    <p>James Cook sailed to the east coast of Australia only one hundred and fifty years later, in 1770,
                        and immediately
                        declared it an English possession. A royal "penal colony" for criminals was created here.
                        Representatives of the British
                        authorities, who arrived in 1788 with the "first fleet" to the shores of Australia, founded the
                        city of Sydney, which
                        was subsequently proclaimed the administrative center of the British colony of New South Wales,
                        created in 1824.
                        Aborigines were hunted, and bonuses were given for the dead. Often the colonists staged real
                        raids. Not surprisingly, a
                        hundred years later, most of the indigenous population was exterminated.</p>
                    <p>The end of the 18th and the entire 19th century for Australia is the time of geographical
                        discoveries. In 1797, the
                        exploration of the shores of the continent began by the talented English hydrographer Flinders.
                        He confirmed the
                        existence of the Bass Strait, explored the coasts of Tasmania and South Australia, and made many
                        other discoveries. By
                        the 19th century, the contours of the mainland were mostly mapped, but the interior remained a
                        "blank spot". More than a
                        dozen large expeditions were equipped to explore the interior of Australia, attempts were made
                        to cross the continent.</p>
                    <p>For the first time, Burke managed to cross the continent from south to north, leading a
                        well-equipped expedition in
                        1860-1861. Burke went from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria, but died along with his
                        companion on the way back.</p>
                    <p>In 1851, a gold rush began in Australia. This seriously changed the demographic situation on the
                        continent. An influx of
                        immigrants from Great Britain, Ireland, other European countries, North America and China began.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, an interesting fact is that in 1911 the construction of the city of Canberra began,
                        specifically in the role of
                        the capital. This was done to resolve the conflict between two cities: Sydney and Melbourne,
                        both of which claimed the
                        seat of the capital.</p>
                    <p>Between the First and Second World Wars, Australia received from Great Britain some territories
                        that were previously
                        directly subordinate to London: Norfolk Island (1914), Ashmore and Cartier Islands (1931) and
                        claims to the Australian
                        Antarctic Territory (1933). Australia gained independence under the Statute of Westminster in
                        1931.</p>
                    <p>On September 3, 1939, shortly after the German invasion of Poland, Australia declared war on
                        Germany, thus entering
                        World War II. During the war years, 993 thousand people out of 6.9 million people of the
                        country's population served in
                        the country's armed forces. Australian military formations took part in operations in Europe. In
                        addition, the territory
                        of Australia for the first time in history was subjected to a direct attack by the enemy.</p>
                    <p>After the Second World War, the Australian government began a massive program to receive
                        immigrants from Europe. Between
                        1948 and 1975, 2 million new residents arrived in Australia. Since 1973, the flow of Asian
                        migrants began, which
                        significantly changed the demographic and cultural life of the country.</p>
                    <p>Since 1986, Australia has finally ceased constitutional ties with Great Britain, however, until
                        now, the British Queen
                        has been considered the formal head of state. The de facto head of state is the Prime Minister
                        of Australia.</p>
